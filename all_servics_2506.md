Understanding the long output of `systemctl` and deciding what you **need** or **don't need** depends on your **use case** (e.g., development workstation, server, minimal setup). Here's a structured approach to analyze and decide:

---

## üß† 1. Understand What You‚Äôre Looking At

When you run:

```bash
systemctl
```

You are seeing a **list of active systemd units**‚Äîthese include:

* **Services** (e.g. `apache2.service`, `docker.service`)
* **Mounts** (e.g. `snap-core20-2582.mount`)
* **Sockets** (e.g. `docker.socket`)
* **Timers** (e.g. `apt-daily.timer`)
* **Targets** (e.g. `multi-user.target`, `graphical.target`)
* **Devices** (hardware detected and plugged in)

Each line shows:

* **Name** of the unit
* **LOAD**: Was the unit definition file properly read?
* **ACTIVE**: Is it active now?
* **SUB**: More detailed status (e.g. "running", "exited", "failed")
* **DESCRIPTION**: Human-readable summary

---

## üîç 2. Focus First on Services

You likely care most about the `*.service` units.

To list only services:

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service
```

---

## ‚úÖ 3. What You Likely Need (Common Essentials)

Here are services you should probably **keep enabled** unless you know otherwise:

| Service                          | Purpose                                                     |

## üö´ 4. What You Might Not Need

These may be safely **disabled** depending on your use case:

| Service                             | Remove If...                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apache2`                           | You‚Äôre not hosting a website                                                                    |
| `clamav-freshclam`                  | You don‚Äôt need antivirus scanning (often overkill on Linux desktop)                             |
| `cups*`                             | You don‚Äôt print                                                                                 |
| `landscape-*`                       | You‚Äôre not using Canonical's Landscape server management (these are failing on your system too) |
| `postfix`                           | You're not running a local mail server                                                          |
| `openvpn`                           | You're not using VPN manually                                                                   |
| `libvirtd`, `virtlogd`, `virtlockd` | You don‚Äôt use KVM/QEMU virtualization                                                           |
| `mono-xsp4`                         | You don‚Äôt run Mono/.NET web services                                                            |
| `snap-canonical-livepatch*`         | You don‚Äôt use Canonical Livepatch (kernel updates without rebooting)                            |
| `docker`                            | You're not running containers                                                                   |
| `mysql`, `postgresql`               | You're not developing with those databases                                                      |
| `ntpsec`                            | You already use systemd-timesyncd or don‚Äôt need time sync (not recommended to disable)          |

To **disable** a service:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable <name>.service
```

To **stop it immediately**:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop <name>.service
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 5. Recommendations Based on Your Output

Here are a few services from your list that are **failing** and likely safe to disable if you're not using Canonical's Landscape:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable landscape-api.service
sudo systemctl disable landscape-appserver.service
sudo systemctl disable landscape-async-frontend.service
sudo systemctl disable landscape-job-handler.service
sudo systemctl disable landscape-msgserver.service
sudo systemctl disable landscape-package-upload.service
sudo systemctl disable landscape-pingserver.service
```

Also, `apache2.service` is **failing**‚Äîdisable it if you don't use Apache:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable apache2.service
```

---

## üß™ 6. Experiment Cautiously

If you're unsure whether something is needed:

1. **Disable it but don‚Äôt remove it yet:**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl disable some-service
   sudo systemctl stop some-service
   ```

2. Reboot and check your system. If nothing breaks, you can leave it disabled.

---

## üßº 7. Clean Up with `systemctl --failed`

See all services that failed:

```bash
systemctl --failed
```

Then investigate and disable them if unnecessary.

---

## üì¶ 8. Remove Software You Don't Need

Once you‚Äôve disabled services you don‚Äôt need, you can uninstall the related packages:

```bash
sudo apt remove apache2 landscape-client clamav*
```
