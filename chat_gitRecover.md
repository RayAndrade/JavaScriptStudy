# üõ†Ô∏è Git Recovery Summary: JavaScriptStudy Project

## ‚ùó Problem

While working on the `JavaScriptStudy` project, the hidden `.git/` directory was **accidentally deleted** using the command:

```bash
sudo rm -r .git/
```

This removed all Git metadata, including commit history, remote origin info, branches, and version tracking. The working directory (project files) remained intact, but the project was no longer recognized as a Git repository.

Attempts to run `git status` inside the project resulted in:

```
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

The Git repository was successfully **restored from GitHub** using the following steps:

### 1. **Cloned the remote repository**

```bash
cd ~/Projects
git clone https://github.com/RayAndrade/JavaScriptStudy.git temp-repo
```

This provided a clean copy of the repository with full Git history and `.git/` metadata intact.

---

### 2. **Copied local files into the cloned repo**

To avoid copying any corrupted or nested `.git` directories from the broken project:

```bash
rsync -av --exclude='.git' JavaScriptStudy/ temp-repo/
```

This preserved all source code and excluded any leftover Git data.

---

### 3. **Removed submodule reference (if applicable)**

Git originally tried to treat the original project folder as a submodule, so it was removed:

```bash
git rm --cached JavaScriptStudy
rm -rf JavaScriptStudy/.git
```

Then the clean version was re-copied and staged:

```bash
rsync -av --exclude='.git' ../JavaScriptStudy/ JavaScriptStudy/
git add JavaScriptStudy
git commit -m "Recovered local files after accidental .git deletion"
```

---

### 4. **Switched to SSH to avoid login prompts**

To stop GitHub from asking for username/password:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:RayAndrade/JavaScriptStudy.git
```

---

### 5. **Pushed changes back to GitHub**

```bash
git push
```

Confirmed that everything pushed successfully without further login prompts.

---

### 6. **Replaced broken project folder**

```bash
cd ~/Projects
rm -rf JavaScriptStudy
mv temp-repo JavaScriptStudy
```

Now the working `JavaScriptStudy` directory is fully restored with:

* All original files
* Connected Git repo
* Remote history
* SSH authentication

---

## ‚úÖ Status

* [x] Git restored
* [x] Remote connection working via SSH
* [x] Full push/pull functionality verified
* [x] No login prompts
* [x] Project files intact

Let me know if you want this saved as a `.md` file, or if you want a `.gitignore` or any automation for backups going forward.
