## 🗂️ What Is the Memento Design Pattern?

The **Memento** pattern is a behavioral pattern that **captures and restores an object’s internal state** without exposing its internals to the outside world.

Think of it like a **save game feature**: you store a snapshot of the current state so you can reload it later if something goes wrong.

---

## 🤔 Why Would I Use It?

* When you need to implement **undo** or **rollback** features in your application.
* When you want to keep the details of an object’s state private but still save and restore it.
* When you want to let users revisit previous states without breaking encapsulation.

---

## ✅ Benefits of the Memento Pattern

* Makes implementing undo and redo features much easier.
* Keeps the object’s internal state secure and hidden from other classes.
* Allows external code to manage state snapshots without needing to understand object internals.

## 🧩 Summary

The Memento pattern is about **saving state invisibly**:

> “I’ll tuck this away safely so I can go back later if I need to.”

It’s perfect for features like undo, history, or state snapshots.

## 🧠 S.W\.O.T. Analysis — Memento Pattern

### ✅ **Strengths**

1. Supports undo/redo functionality in a clean, reusable way.
2. Preserves encapsulation by not exposing private details.
3. Makes it easy to store and restore multiple states over time.

---

### ❌ **Weaknesses**

1. Can use a lot of memory if snapshots are very large or frequent.
2. Managing many mementos can become complex to coordinate.
3. May add overhead to your application if misused.

---

### 🌱 **Opportunities**

1. Teaches juniors how to handle versioning and state history.
2. Encourages careful thinking about which data needs to be saved and restored.
3. Builds skills for building document editors, games, or transactional systems.

---

### ⚠️ **Threats**

1. Overuse may result in performance issues with too many saved states.
2. Poorly managed mementos can create bugs or unexpected rollbacks.
3. Storing sensitive data in snapshots can cause security concerns if not handled properly.
