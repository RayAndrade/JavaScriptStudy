## 🧩 What Is the Strategy Design Pattern?

The **Strategy** pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines a **family of algorithms**, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.

Think of it like choosing a **payment method** online — credit card, PayPal, or Apple Pay — each is a different strategy for paying.

## 🤔 Why Would I Use It?

* When you need to swap different algorithms without changing the client code.
* When you want to avoid hardcoding multiple conditional statements to pick algorithms.
* When you want to isolate how an algorithm works from where it’s used.

---

## ✅ Benefits of the Strategy Pattern

* Promotes cleaner, more maintainable code by separating algorithms.
* Makes it easy to add new strategies without modifying existing code.
* Allows dynamic switching of algorithms at runtime.

## 🧩 Summary

The Strategy pattern is about **selecting an algorithm at runtime**:

> “I can pay with a credit card today, but PayPal tomorrow.”

It makes code flexible, extensible, and easier to evolve.

## 🧠 S.W\.O.T. Analysis — Strategy Pattern

### ✅ **Strengths**

1. Simplifies code by isolating algorithms in their own classes.
2. Supports easy swapping or adding of new strategies.
3. Keeps the client free from algorithm selection logic.

---

### ❌ **Weaknesses**

1. Introduces extra classes that can overwhelm beginners.
2. May be overkill if you only ever need one algorithm.
3. Clients still need to choose which strategy to apply, requiring care.

---

### 🌱 **Opportunities**

1. Helps juniors learn to separate **what** an algorithm does from **how** it is executed.
2. Encourages better thinking about modularity and clean interfaces.
3. Prepares developers for using plug-in style architectures or policy patterns.


### ⚠️ **Threats**

1. Overuse can add unnecessary complexity in otherwise simple code.
2. Poorly organized strategies might duplicate code.
3. Miscommunication about which strategy is active could cause subtle bugs.
