## 📝 What Is the Template Method Design Pattern?

The **Template Method** pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines the **skeleton of an algorithm** in a method, letting subclasses fill in the specific steps.

Think of it like a **recipe**: the structure stays the same, but you can swap out ingredients or steps as needed.

---

## 🤔 Why Would I Use It?

* When you want to enforce a consistent sequence of steps while letting subclasses handle the details.
* When you have algorithms that share structure but differ in a few parts.
* When you want to reuse code and avoid duplicating boilerplate.

---

## ✅ Benefits of the Template Method Pattern

* Promotes reuse by keeping common algorithm steps in a superclass.
* Makes changes easier since you only override what differs.
* Encourages consistent processes across related subclasses.

## 🧩 Summary

The Template Method is about **defining a framework with customizable hooks**:

> “Bake the cake this way, but you can choose the flavor.”

It supports consistent and extensible design while encouraging reuse.

## 🧠 S.W\.O.T. Analysis — Template Method Pattern

### ✅ **Strengths**

1. Simplifies code by sharing a fixed algorithm structure.
2. Makes subclass implementations easier by requiring only custom step overrides.
3. Supports consistent behavior across related classes.

---

### ❌ **Weaknesses**

1. May introduce tight coupling between the base class and its subclasses.
2. Makes it harder to change algorithm steps without affecting all subclasses.
3. Can limit flexibility if the algorithm’s structure must change frequently.

---

### 🌱 **Opportunities**

1. Helps juniors see how to separate invariants from variations.
2. Encourages reuse of workflow steps while still supporting customization.
3. Builds skills valuable for framework and library design.

---

### ⚠️ **Threats**

1. Overuse may lead to deep inheritance hierarchies that are hard to manage.
2. Misuse can cause subclasses to override too much, breaking the template.
3. Poorly documented templates can confuse maintainers about what’s fixed versus what’s customizable.
