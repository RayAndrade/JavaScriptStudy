Let's delve into these foundational concepts of JavaScript.

### 1. Variables and Data Types:

**Variables** are named containers that store data values. The value inside a variable can change or vary, hence the name 'variable'. In JavaScript, variables can be declared using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword, with `let` and `const` being introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and preferred in modern usage.

Example:
```javascript
let name = "John";
const pi = 3.14159;
```

JavaScript has dynamic typing, meaning the data type of a variable can change as code executes. Here are the main **data types**:

- **Number**: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.
  ```javascript
  let age = 25;
  let average = 15.7;
  ```

- **String**: Represents a sequence of characters.
  ```javascript
  let greeting = "Hello, world!";
  ```

- **Boolean**: Represents a true or false value.
  ```javascript
  let isOnline = true;
  ```

- **Undefined**: Represents a variable that has been declared but has no value assigned.
  ```javascript
  let x;
  console.log(x); // undefined
  ```

- **Null**: Represents a null or "empty" value.
  ```javascript
  let y = null;
  ```

- **Object**: Collections of properties.
  ```javascript
  let person = {firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe"};
  ```

- **Symbol** (Introduced in ES6): Represents a unique and immutable data type.
  ```javascript
  const sym = Symbol("description");
  ```

- **BigInt** (Introduced in ES11): Represents large integers.
  ```javascript
  const bigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
  ```

### 2. Operators:

Operators perform operations on variables and values. Here are some commonly used operators:

- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (remainder), `++` (increment), `--` (decrement)
  ```javascript
  let a = 10 + 5; // 15
  ```

- **Comparison Operators**: `==` (equal to), `===` (strict equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `!==` (strict not equal to), `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
  ```javascript
  if (age === 25) {...}
  ```

- **Logical Operators**: `&&` (and), `||` (or), `!` (not)
  ```javascript
  if (age > 20 && isOnline) {...}
  ```

- **Assignment Operators**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
  ```javascript
  a += 5; // same as a = a + 5;
  ```

- **Ternary Operator**: `(condition) ? (value if true) : (value if false)`
  ```javascript
  let result = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
  ```

### 3. Type Conversion and Coercion:

**Type Conversion** is converting one type of data to another, often done manually.
- String to Number:
  ```javascript
  let val = Number("123");
  ```

- Number to String:
  ```javascript
  let str = String(123);
  ```

**Type Coercion** is when JavaScript automatically converts one type of data to another, often due to the demands of an operation.
- When a string and a number are used with `+`, the number is coerced into a string:
  ```javascript
  console.log("5" + 3); // "53"
  ```

- With other operators, strings are coerced into numbers:
  ```javascript
  console.log("5" - 3); // 2
  ```

Being aware of type coercion is crucial, as unexpected coercion can lead to unforeseen bugs. This is also why the strict equality (`===`) is recommended over equality (`==`), as the former doesn't coerce types.

By understanding these basics of JavaScript — variables and data types, operators, and type conversion and coercion — you're well on your way to writing effective JavaScript code.
