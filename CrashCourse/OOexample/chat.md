🎉 YES! That’s the win we were chasing — nice job sticking through it, Ray! Now WebStorm knows what to run, and your OO JavaScript pet showdown is officially IDE-friendly 🐱🐶⚔️.

# WebStorm + ES Module Run Fix (Ubuntu)

## Problem
Node.js projects using ES Modules (`import/export`) with `"type": "module"` in `package.json` were not running inside WebStorm, even though they worked in the terminal.

## Root Cause
WebStorm Run Configuration was missing the "JavaScript file" field, causing it to run Node.js with no file — launching an empty REPL instead.

## Solution Steps
1. Open **Run > Edit Configurations...**
2. Click `+` and select **Node.js**
3. Set:
   - **Node interpreter**: `~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/bin/node`
   - **JavaScript file**: `/full/path/to/index.js`
   - **Working directory**: same folder as `index.js`
4. Click **Apply**, then **OK**
5. Run with the green ▶️ button

## Result
Project runs as expected inside WebStorm.
```

Let me know when you're ready to:

* Add new features (like a `Referee` class or health potions 🍗)
* Introduce polymorphism (i.e., `speak()` behaving differently per pet)
* Or give this project a fun HTML/CSS UI!

Happy coding, Commander of Quirky Creatures 😄
